// Adsterra ad units — single source of truth.
//
// Copy each unit's GET CODE snippet verbatim into `src`. The network has used at
// least two shapes over time and they are not interchangeable:
//
//   old:  <script src="//www.highrevenueformat.com/<key>/invoke.js"></script>
//   new:  <script src="https://bauval.org/22/<key>"></script>
//
// Guessing the URL from the key produced a 404 on this account's units, so the
// full URL is stored rather than reconstructed.
//
// A slot with an empty key renders nothing, so this file is safe to ship before
// a unit is approved — ads appear only once the key is filled in.
//
// NOTE: Adsterra also expects its ads.txt record in public/ads.txt (from the
// dashboard). Without it, demand-side platforms cannot verify the inventory.
